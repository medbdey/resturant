        <p>Pizzaro started as a tiny neighborhood spot where the owner, a lifelong pizza lover, spent years perfecting his dough recipe and sauce. What began as a simple dream turned into a restaurant known for its warm atmosphere and honest, high-quality food. Every pizza is made with fresh ingredients, slow-fermented dough, and a sauce cooked daily, giving each slice a rich flavor that keeps people coming back. Pizzaro’s story is built on passion, and its food reflects that care in every bite.</p>
